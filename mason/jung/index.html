<h2>Preferential Attachment - a demonstration of JUNG and MASON integration</h2> 
By <a href="http://www.latek.org">Maciek Latek</a> 2007 
</table>

<font size="-2" color="gray">[Requires JFreeChart and JUNG]</font>

<p> This is a model of simple network dynamics inspired by Barabasi's preferential attachment theory. To compile and run, 
both MASON as well as JUNG  are required, please refer to <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/">MASON</a> and <a href="http://jung.sourceforge.net/">JUNG</a> 
for instructions on how to set up project that would have required libraries. The jar file that combines all dependencies can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.css.gmu.edu/~mlatek/downloads/JungDisplay/">here</a>.</p>

<p> Following questions are covered in this demonstration:

<ul>

<li> How to describe interactions between MASON agent's with JUNG's network.
<li> How to display resulting network in a way that is integrated with GuiState.
<li> How to code Poisson activation of agents.

</ul>

In addition to that, one way of using MASON's new interfaces to JFreeChart to plot different things (a histogram in this case) is shown. 
From within the Model tab following parameters of the simulations can be set:

<ul>

<li> <b>N</b> - Number of agents \ nodes. 
<li> <b>T</b> - Number of activations each agent will undergo.
<li> <b>Temperature</b> - Constant used in Boltzman transformation - the higher it is the bigger the preference for high degree nodes.
<li> <b>UpdateInterval</b> - How much time is to elapse between subsequent updates of graph display.

</ul>

Other things, like exact layout algorithm used and maximal degree of nodes, are hard coded.
