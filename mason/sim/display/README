sim/display

This package holds visualization widgets for the simulation toolkit.  Most
3D visualization widgets are located instead in sim/display3d.

MASON models may register themselves to be displayed when the user 
chooses "New Simulation..." from Console.java (or runs [java 
sim.display.Console] ).  Classes register themselves in the 
simulation.classes file.


Classes:


GUIState.java

An object which holds the model (the SimState) and all visualizers for 
the model at present under one umbrella.


Controller.java

An interface for widgets which control the simulation and the schedule.


SimpleController.java

A very simple widget for controlling the simulation and the schedule, 
mostly useful for games or other tasks for which Console.java is not a 
good idea.  Otherwise, rarely used.


Console.java

An elaborate widget for controlling the simulation and the schedule.  
Includes facilties for playing, stopping, pausing, resuming, saving and 
loading models, creating new models, changing model parameters, 
visualizing inspectors on the model, and other functionality.  Yes, 
Console.java really compiles to over 64 classes.  Anonymous classes are 
great.


Display.java

A 2D visualization widget for displaying 2D fields and their subsidiary 
objects.  Works with various 2D Portrayals to display and inspect those 
objects.  Capable of scrolling and scaling, making movies and pictures, 
etc.


SimApplet.java

A simple Applet subclass for setting up MASON as an applet in a web browser.
